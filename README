Data preprocessing:
    - ** You shouldn't need to run this -- our preprocessed data is saved as
        train_copy_5, train_copy_6, etc. **

    - To run: python3 data_cleaning.py

    - reads in train.json (training data from kaggle)
    - To change ingredient dictionary (file of duplicate ingredients to be replaced),
      change X:
        - (input) Line 4: ing_dict_X.json
        - (output) Line 22: train_copy_X.json
        - Valid X: 5, 6, 7 (best results=5)
        - (Ingredient dictionaries are in the ing_dicts folder)

    - output:
        - overwrites (or creates) train_copy_X.json with new cleaned data


Main program:
  - To run: python3 final_project.py
  - Outputs accuracies to results.json

  - To use unprocessed data:
      - Make the file on line 108 'train.json'
  - To use preprocssed data:
      - Make the file on line 108 'train_copy_X.json'
      - Valid: X = 5, 6, 7 (best results=5)

  - The main program automatically creates a one-hot encoding of the data
    and splits it into train and test sets

  - To run Random Forest:
      - make sure line 25 is uncommented

  - To run Neural Network:
      - make sure line 26 is uncommented

  - To output graphs of results (requires that both models were run):
      - uncomment line 31
